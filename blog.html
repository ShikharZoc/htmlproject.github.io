				<h1 align="center" style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#75046b;">Technology!</h1>
				<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#e2b2f7;"> One of the hot and burning question in today's world would be: "What is <stong>Technology</stong>?" And the answer undoubtedly differs from person to person. Everyone has their own prospective and take towards technology. In my opinion, technology is a source of knowledge and ideas which when executed properly, results into innovation.Technologies like <strong>internet technology</strong> if properly used, could make our life easier and a lot more comfortable than the past. Since internet technologies are used in a lot of field  of our daily life, it is nearly impossible to run away from it. </p>

				<br>
				<h1 align="center" style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#75046b;">Internet Technology on a Daily Life Basis!</h1>
				<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#e2b2f7;">Modern science and technology has become an important part of our daily life. Among the various technologies, internet technology is developing and growing very rapidly. It is used in almost every field/sector like work, education, household, entertainment and so many others. It has changed my life immensely. The things that looked impossible a decade ago seems pretty obivious and simple now because of development of internet technology. My life has been benifited a lot by this. Now a days, we have got phones and watches smarter than a normal human being. We can explore the entire world just with a smartphone in our hand. It's that easy and simple. With the advancement in internet technology, I can now communicate with anyone, explore any place and perform numerious tasks just by sitting at home. But I feel technology has affected my life both positively and negatively.</p>
				<br><br> 
				<h1 align="center" style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#75046b;">Positives of internet technology:</h1>

				
				<ul style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#e2b2f7;">
				<li>Medicine - Medicine has advanced since internet technology has improved tremendously.A lot of diseases are cured nowadays compared to past because of technology.Concept of tele-robotic surgery is possible only because of internet technology. It positively impacted our health and the overall healthcare system.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Learning -Thanks to various internet technologies, we are able to educate ourselves on any subject we would like. There are several online universities and online classes in current time which allows you to study your designated subjects just sitting at home. Also, there are different programs, online schools, and courses that we can take and pay for, in order to learn new skills and information.</li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
				<h1 align="center" style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#75046b;">Negatives of technology:</h1>

				
				<ul style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#e2b2f7;">
				<li>Communication - Unfortunately, due to internet technology, there exists a face-to-face communication gap betwwen humans. Even though this one also has a good side - such as allowing us to keep in touch with friends and family that do not leave near us, the technology still impacted the way we talk to each other drastically for the worse.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Productivity - Technology, especially social media, impacts our productivity beyond recognition. Today, one of our biggest struggles is to give up our addiction to social media. And it really seems like an impossible thing to do. Nowadays it is very easy to get distracted and technology is one of the main reasons for this.</li>
